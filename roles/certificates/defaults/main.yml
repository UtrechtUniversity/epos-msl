# The certificate mode specifies how the playbook handles certificates:
# selfsigned (default): install a selfsigned certificate if no certificate is
#                       present
# ignore:               don't install any certificates
# static:               install a certificate provided by the playbook configuration
cert_mode: selfsigned
